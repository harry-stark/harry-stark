### Hye I'm Harry Saini, but you can call me Harsimranjeet Singh Saini.

- My development interests lean towards :
  - High Performance computing. 
  - Developing and extending different scientific computing frameworks (mainly focusing on developing/optimising new ops and kernels with parallel programming frameworks like CUDA, Eigen and OpenCL).
  - Production ML.

- Tools and Frameworks I'm adept in: Python,Tensorflow, Pytorch, C++, CUDA, Eigen, JAX, Numpy, Pandas etc. 

- I've pursued/pursuing varied research interests (whenever i feel like) in different domains like Quantum Computing, Natural Computation, AI/ML and Convex Optimization applications.

- I also have extensive experience with NLP models and their applications, I've tinkered around with LLM (DeBERTa, BERT) capabilities on Zero Shot NLI. Also interested in knowledge management of Transfomer based models. 

- Currently thinking about spending some more time on production ML.

Apart from this, I usually spend my remaining day finding new songs for my anxiety filled brain and critiquing anime/movie plot holes.
